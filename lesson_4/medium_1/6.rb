# The end result is the sameâ€”namely that instance variable `@template` is returned, but the two implementations take two ways of getting there. The first tries to find a local variable `template`, but is not found, and then Ruby will proceed to look for an in-scope method `template` which it finds as an instant method in the `Computer` class. In the second, because `self` is prepended, Ruby will find the getter method `Computer#template` to return the instance variable `@template`.
